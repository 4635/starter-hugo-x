The project is Moon Shots Program. The program is inspired by America’s drive a generation ago to put a man on the moon, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has launched an ambitious and comprehensive action plan, called the Moon Shots Program®, to make a giant leap for patients – to rapidly and dramatically reduce mortality and suffering in several major cancers. The Moon Shots Program is focused on thirteen cancer types, but lessons learned from these cancers will be used to impact all cancer types. Research platforms support the Moon Shots efforts, enhancing the speed at which discoveries are translated into clinical outcomes for patients.
